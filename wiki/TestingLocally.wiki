#summary Instructions for testing the application locally.

= Introduction =

Making code changes and testing them locally requires a few steps. The primary complications are 'compiling' the Javascript and using the correct App Engine settings.


= Details =

  * Install Google App Engine for Python 2.7.
  * Install Subversion.
  * Download the repository, following the directions on the source page.
  * When modifying the Javascript, it is necessary to run ./compile.sh in the main directory before the changes are visible.
  * Run the App Engine development server with --high_replication.
  * Visit the url localhost:8080/refresh_counties to prepare the cached county list. (this is a temporary hack)
